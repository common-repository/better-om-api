A better version of the OptimizeMember API, specially tailored for the Dutch service Autorespond.

== Description ==

A better version of the OptimizeMember API. This API is specially tailored for the Dutch service Autorespond, but will most likely also work with other Autoresponders.

This version is currently only available in the Dutch language. A translation to English is in the works.

With this plugin you have the option to:

* Force the API to check if the user already exists. If the user already exist, simply add the level to the user or do nothing else.
* Get notifications by email of added users, levels and packages. This way you don't have to check if a transaction completed succesfully.
* Log requests and see the results
